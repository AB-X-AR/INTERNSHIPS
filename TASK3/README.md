**Overview**


This program evaluates the strength of a password based on specific complexity criteria. It ensures that the password meets minimum security standards by checking for various elements like length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

**How It Works**


Complexity Check: The program analyzes the password to ensure it:
- Is at least 8 characters long.
- Contains at least one uppercase letter.
- Contains at least one lowercase letter.
- Includes at least one digit.
- Includes at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
- User Input: You input a password, and the program checks whether it meets the complexity requirements.
- Output: The program will notify you if the password is strong or if it fails to meet any of the specified criteria, providing specific feedback on what needs to be improved.

**Usage Example**


1. Run the program.
2. Enter the password you want to evaluate.
3. The program will display whether the password is strong or indicate which criteria it failed to meet.
