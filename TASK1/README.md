**Overview**

Caeser Cipher program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a specified number of places in the alphabet.

**How It Works**


Encryption/Decryption: The program shifts each letter in the input text by the specified amount. If you choose to encrypt, letters are shifted forward; for decryption, they are shifted backward.
User Input: You enter the message, choose the shift value (how many places to move each letter), and select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message.
Output: The program then displays the resulting encrypted or decrypted text.

**Steps for running caesar cipher:**


1. Open Terminal or CMD for Windows
2. Copy this Repositoy and clone this "git clone https://github.com/wiz..... .git
3. Now run program by "python caesar.py"
4. Enter the Input Text "Hello"
5. Now enter the Shift Key Value "3"
6. Now choose "e" for Encryption or "d" for Decryption
