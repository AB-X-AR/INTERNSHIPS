**Overview**

Caeser Cipher program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a specified number of places in the alphabet.

**How It Works**


Encryption/Decryption: The program shifts each letter in the input text by the specified amount. If you choose to encrypt, letters are shifted forward; for decryption, they are shifted backward.
User Input: You enter the message, choose the shift value (how many places to move each letter), and select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message.
Output: The program then displays the resulting encrypted or decrypted text.
