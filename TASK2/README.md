**Overview**


This program allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using simple pixel manipulation. It alters the pixel values of an image using a specified key, making the image unreadable without the correct key.

**How It Works**


Encryption/Decryption: The program modifies the pixel values of the image by applying a bitwise XOR operation with a given key. The same process is used for both encryption and decryption.
User Input: You select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt an image, then provide the image file path, the output file path, and an integer key for the operation.
Output: The program saves the encrypted or decrypted image to the specified output path.

**Usage Example**


1. Run the program.
2. Choose whether to encrypt (1) or decrypt (2) an image.
3. Enter the file path of the image you want to process.
4. Provide the path where the processed image will be saved.
5. Enter an integer key for encryption or decryption.
6. The program will save the resulting image to the specified location.
